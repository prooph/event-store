## Overview

Prooph Event Store is capable of persisting event objects that are organized in streams. The [EventStore](src/EventStore.php)
itself is a facade for different persistence adapters (see the list below) and adds event-driven hook points for [plugins](src/Plugin/Plugin.php)
which make the Event Store highly customizable.
